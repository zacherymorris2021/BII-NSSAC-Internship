# NSSAC_Internship
Internship with Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative, NSSAC Division.

## Overview
â€¢ One of 15 interns at the Computing for Global Challenges internship program through UVA's Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative's Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing (NSSAC) division.

## Tasks
1.) Investigated and explored different ideas on speeding up computations in EpiFast and other infectious disease simulation models.

2.) Wrote programs to scale a given social contact network in C++ (see [here](https://github.com/zacherymorris2021/BII-NSSAC-Internship/blob/master/scaling_network_v2.cpp), [here](https://github.com/zacherymorris2021/BII-NSSAC-Internship/blob/master/SocialNetwork_Scaling.cpp), and [here](https://github.com/zacherymorris2021/BII-NSSAC-Internship/blob/master/scaling_network))

3.) Extracted data of a specified climatic variable for US locations while aggregating it to specified spatial/temporal resolution using Python and Pandas library (see [here](https://github.com/zacherymorris2021/BII-NSSAC-Internship/blob/master/aggregate_climate_data.py))

4.) Ran statistical analysis (and created visualizations) on CDC state level influenza data and weather data using Pandas and Matplotlib libraries (see [here](https://github.com/zacherymorris2021/BII-NSSAC-Internship/blob/master/flu_activity_visualization.py))

5.) Used Rivanna, a high-performance computing system est. by UVA, to run these programs and obtain workable data.

6.) Wrote project overview paper [here](https://github.com/zacherymorris2021/BII-NSSAC-Internship/blob/master/C4GC_FinalPaper_ZacheryMorris.pdf), designed project poster (see [here](https://github.com/zacherymorris2021/BII-NSSAC-Internship/blob/master/C4GC%20Poster_Zachery_Morris.pdf)), and presented research to the division.

## Note
I had to recently upload my old files from the companies repo.
